## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Felipe Puyol
I'm currently pursuing the MITx MicroMaster of Statistics and Data Science and working as an Ecommerce Manager. I believe data has the potential to transform the way we think and make decisions as a society. 

My skillset includes:
- Languages: SQL (Microsoft SQL Server), Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), Java
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, PowerPoint, GitHub, SAP ERP

Aside from my work, you can find me reading non-fiction books, playing basketball and tennis, and finding the best hiking spots in my free time. Please feel free to connect and reach out to me at any time! I love discussing all things data-related as well as hobbies/interests.
