## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Felipe Puyol
I'm currently pursuing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and working as a Freelance Data Analyst. I believe data has the potential to transform the way we think and make decisions as a society. In my professional work, I strive to use data storytelling as a way to help organizations build brand equity and cultivate meaningful relationships with their customers.

My skillset includes:
- Languages: SQL (Microsoft SQL Server), Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), Java
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, PowerPoint, GitHub, SAP ERP

Aside from my work, you can find me reading non-fiction books, playing basketball and tennis, and finding the best hiking spots in the city in my free time. Please feel free to connect and reach out to me at any time! I love discussing all things data-related as well as hobbies/interests.
